<p>African Wild dogs used to have territory that spread all over the Africa in almost every country. Today, they are likely extinct in at least 18 of those countries. To the left is a map showing their current occupancy.</p> 

<p>Like many species that are classified as 'endangered,' the biggest cause for their dwindling population is the presence of humans. Human populations are spreading outward and using more and more land for agriculture and livestock, deeming land previously used by wildlife to be uninhabitable. With humans and wild dogs suddenly living so close to one another, there is bound to be trouble. The dogs are often shot or caught in traps when they enter farmlands out of the farmers' fear that they will make off with the livestock. There was a time when they were killed more consistenly by those who misunderstood them, thinking them to be bloodthirsty mongrels. That stage has passed, but it has done a lot of damage.</p>

<p>These packs of dogs are now far more elusive than ever, and in some areas they are close to being wiped out for good. </p>
